# Legacy Employee Database Analysis: Pewlett Hackard

**Project Overview:**

This project centers around the comprehensive analysis of Pewlett Hackard's legacy employee data spanning the 1980s and 1990s. The primary objectives are data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, encompassing six CSV files containing employee information.

**Project Components:**

**Part 1: Data Modeling**
- A meticulous inspection of the CSV files was undertaken to conceptualize the database structure.
- An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was crafted using QuickDBD, delineating the interconnections between the tables.

**Part 2: Data Engineering**
- Robust table schemas were designed for each of the six CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
- CSV files were imported into their corresponding SQL tables, ensuring data integrity and organization.

**Part 3: Data Analysis**
- An array of SQL queries was executed to extract pertinent insights from the dataset. These queries encompassed diverse aspects of employee information, including personal details, hire dates, managerial hierarchy, departmental affiliations, and frequency counts of employee last names.

**Requirements:**

- Data Modeling: An ERD or comprehensive table schemas outlining the database structure.
- Data Engineering: Explicit table definitions, column data types, primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and establishment of table relationships.
- Data Analysis: A series of SQL queries tailored to address specific data analysis tasks and questions.
- Deployment: The project, including all pertinent files for data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, should be accessible via a GitHub repository.
